# publish.md

Markdown based publishing platform in early stage of development.

The project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and will be aligned with [`obsidian.md`](https://obsidian.md).

The problem primarily I'm trying to address is, not having a simple enough blog engine to launch and maintain a blog. WordPress is now too heavy, and a costly choice for a minimalistic blog. Jekyll is an awesome tool, but sort of not simplest enough for my expectation.

This was planned as a pet project for me to start a blog of my own on GitHub Pages instead go for a hosted solution. After the experience with `obsidian.md` and `Obsidian Publish`, now I'm certain that there is more to this project. The direction I'm planning to take is to develop a markdown-based full-fledged publishing platform and a toolchain on it.

I don't have any intention or time to reinvent the wheel but just fill the void we have now.

Ideas and collaborations are most welcome.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
